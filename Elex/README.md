# ELEX 3D vision fix
========

This work in progress fix aims to make the game "ELEX" 3D vision ready.

#####What is fixed:
- Shadows from sun 
- Point lights (they still have some tile issue) 
- Sky
- Most decals (approximate fix)

#####What is not fixed yet:
- Light tiles
- Light shafts
- Some decals
- HUD
- ...

#####Installation:
- Copy this folder structure into the directory which contains the ELEX.exe (should be ./system) so that "dxd3.ini" is in the same directory as the .exe.
- Download latest version of 3Dmigoto and copy d3d11.dll next to the ELEX.exe
